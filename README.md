## Description

The Job Application Tracker is a simple web app designed to help users manage and organize their job search. It allows users to log details about their job applications, such as the company name, position, application date, and status, and displays them in a clean, easy-to-read table. The app saves data in the browser’s local storage, so users can revisit and update their entries anytime. It’s a helpful tool for staying on top of job opportunities and tracking progress during the application process

## Usage

Someone would use this app to stay organized and stress-free during their job search. When you’re applying to multiple positions, it’s easy to lose track of where you’ve applied, what stage you’re at with each company, or when to follow up. This app simplifies everything by keeping all that information in one place.

## Tests

To test the Job Application Tracker, open the index.html file in a modern web browser. Add a job application by filling in the form fields (company, position, date, status) and clicking “Submit.” Ensure the application appears in the table and persists after refreshing the page. Test the “Delete” button to confirm it removes an entry from the table.
